### Features

- Guessing Game Challenge
- In this game, a random integer from 1 to 100 is picked and the players have to guess the number.

- Rules:
--If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, the message "OUT OF BOUNDS" is displayed.
		On a player's first turn, if their guess is:
			Within 10 of the number, "WARM!" is displayed.
			Further than 10 away from the number,  "COLD!" is displayed.
		On all subsequent turns, if a guess is:
			Closer to the number than the previous guess, "WARMER!" is displayed.
			Farther from the number than the previous guess, "COLDER!" is displayed.
		When the player's guess equals the number, a Congratulation message is displayed and the number of guesses was needed to get the correct answer.
